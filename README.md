# react-native-boilerplate
Minimal code to stand up a vanilla React Native boilerplate using Expo to load on phone. Expo was used because I'm developing with a Linux machine and mostly testing on IOS. IOS phone testing isn't allowed on Linux without Expo. 

## to start
- install Expo on your phone
- `git clone`
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`
- It'll either open up a new window, or in the terminal there will be an QR code. Open up your camera's phone and target it at this QR code. This should open up the app in your phone!
